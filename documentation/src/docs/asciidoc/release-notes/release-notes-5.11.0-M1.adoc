=== JUnit Platform

[[release-notes-5.11.0-M1-junit-platform-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* Field and method search algorithms now adhere to standard Java semantics regarding
  whether a given field or method is visible or overridden according to the rules of the
  Java language. See the new
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-supported-utilities-search-semantics, Field and
  Method Search Semantics>> section of the User Guide for details.
* `ReflectionSupport.findFields(...)` now returns a distinct set of fields.
* Fixed parsing of recursive jar URIs which allows the JUnit Platform Launcher to be used
  inside Spring Boot executable jars for Spring Boot 3.2 and later.
* The `junit-platform-suite-engine` now includes configuration provided via
  `@ConfigurationParameter` when selecting tests by `UniqueId`.

[[release-notes-5.11.0-M1-junit-platform-deprecations-and-breaking-changes]]
==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* As mentioned in the _Bug Fixes_ section above, field and method search algorithms now
  adhere to standard Java semantics regarding whether a given field or method is visible
  or overridden according to the rules of the Java language. The changes in the search
  algorithms may, however, result in breaking changes for some use cases. In light of
  that, it is possible to revert to the previous "legacy semantics". See the new
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#extensions-supported-utilities-search-semantics, Field and
  Method Search Semantics>> section of the User Guide for details.

[[release-notes-5.11.0-M1-junit-platform-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* New `ConversionSupport` utility in `junit-platform-commons` which exposes the conversion
  logic that was previously private to JUnit Jupiter's `@ParameterizedTest` infrastructure
  -- for use in third-party extensions and test engines.
* Error messages for type mismatches in `NamespacedHierarchicalStore` now include the
  actual type and value in addition to the required type.

* `JAVA_23` has been added to the `JRE` enum for use with JRE-based execution conditions.
* Improved documentation for semantics of a disabled test regarding class-level lifecycle
  methods and callbacks.
* New `@AutoClose` annotation that can be applied to fields within tests to automatically
  close the annotated resource after test execution. See the
  <<../user-guide/index.adoc#writing-tests-built-in-extensions-AutoClose, User Guide>> for
